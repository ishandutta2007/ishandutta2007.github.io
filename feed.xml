Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a documentation directory: Create a new directory in your project directory, and name it “docs”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install Sphinx: Sphinx is a tool that can generate documentation in several formats, including ReadTheDocs. Install it using pip: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install sphinx</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initialize Sphinx: In the “docs” directory, initialize Sphinx using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sphinx-quickstart</code> command. This command will create a few files and directories to get you started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Configure Sphinx: Edit the “conf.py” file in the “docs” directory to configure Sphinx. Here, you can set the project name, author, version, and other metadata. You can also configure the output format to generate ReadTheDocs documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write documentation: In the “docs” directory, create a new file with the “.rst” extension to write your documentation in reStructuredText format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build documentation: Run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make html</code> command in the “docs” directory to generate HTML documentation. This will create a “build” directory with the HTML files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up ReadTheDocs: Create an account on ReadTheDocs, and add your project. Then, follow the instructions to link your project repository and configure the documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trigger documentation build: Once ReadTheDocs is set up, every time you push changes to your project repository, ReadTheDocs will automatically build and publish the updated documentation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are the general steps to generate ReadTheDocs for a Python project using Sphinx. However, there are additional configuration options and advanced features available with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs that you can explore to customize your documentation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I can guide you on how to generate ReadTheDocs for a Python project.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. Just editiing the md file. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Ishan requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Ishan also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
