I'm Ishan Dutta, an Entrepreneur, Digital Marketer, and Programmer. I specialize in SaaS Development and am passionate about creating helpful tools and applications with intuitive and presentable interfaces.

I'm glad you've come across my website. This is where I organize and share my thoughts and experiences. 
I'll try to write about my notes or opinions about certain topics I recently encountered, 
especially those that I found interesting or had the most trouble articulating.

## Experience

I have experience working with big techs as well as startups.

## Tech stack

C is my weapon of choice, as I can have a comprehensive understanding of most,
if not all, of the language. I even use C for performance-critical parts of my
web apps by compiling them into [WebAssembly](//webassembly.org/). Other
languages that I frequently use are Rust, JavaScript, Python, and Lua, but I
can work with a wide range of languages and tools.

For personal projects, I prefer making things from scratch for educational
purposes. But for work, I used many frameworks, and my personal favorites are
[Svelte](//svelte.dev/) for front-ends and [Axum](//github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
for back-ends. This website is built with [Zola](//www.getzola.org) because of
its ease of setting up, incredible speed, and flexible template engine.
