It was built around 2 years ago as a way to quickly browse and access my web projects. Basically, it was just a grid of project thumbnails, which is pretty boring. During the last 2 years, I changed bits and pieces of it, but it’s still the same boring layout with only a list of projects and some basic information.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><figure><img alt="My old website" src=old-site.png><figcaption>My old website, archived on July 1st, 2022</figcaption></figure><p>So I decided to nuke the old website and build a new one entirely from scratch. I wanted to keep the old website’s project showcasing ability, so I added <a href=/works>a page</a> just for that. This time, instead of calling the GitHub API to get the projects, I just put everything inside a TOML file, which gives me more controls, and I can even display non-web-related projects. The only downside is that I have to manually add new projects to the TOML file and rebuild the website, but I plan on updating my website frequently anyways, so hopefully that won’t be a problem.<h1 id=what-s-new-here>What’s new here</h1><p>Other than for showcasing my projects, I also started a blog on this website! Well, it’s kind of obvious, as you’re reading one of the articles. After browsing the web and looking at amazing pages full of unique contents for a while, I wanted to have my own content. I wanted this website to reflect what I thought and what I learned over time, mostly for me to look back on, but I also wanted to share it with other people. Hopefully, people will encounter this website the same way I came across others. Maybe you’re looking for something, and a search engine lookup leads you to one of my posts. But before speculating, maybe I should start to actually write some blog posts.<p>Other than that, this website now feels more like an actual website. I learned quite a bit of CSS and web design in the last few years, and I’m really proud of the design of this new website. Even though the layout is nothing special and some pages look really bland, but in my opinion, it looks great on most screen sizes and everything feels very well put together. What is currently missing is a dark theme, which should be the first theme I design. However, I got lazy and designed the website with a light theme first. I still want a dark theme and will try to implement it soon.<h1 id=how-is-this-website-made>How is this website made</h1><p>The previous iteration of this website was created with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and the GitHub API. This architecture works, but it’s really annoying to add more pages, let alone to manage an entire blog. I didn’t have any trouble writing CSS or JavaScript, but HTML is a real problem for me:<ol><li>HTML is too static, which can leads to lots of repetition. I want to dynamically generate markups based on some external data.<li>HTML is too verbose; that’s great for structuring a web page, but for writing, it’s absolutely horrible. I want to generate HTML from another markup language that’s better for writing.</ol><p>To solve those problems, I needed a templating engine to dynamically generate HTML and a Markdown compiler to convert Markdown files — which is much better for writing — to HTML files. A tool that uses those technologies and generates HTML is called a static site generator (SSG). It’s very tempting to write my own SSG, but I wanted to focus more on blogging, so for the time being, I’m just going to use something pre-built. It’s not going to be exactly what I want. However, it’s also going to save me from building and maintaining an SSG along with my website.<h2 id=choosing-an-ssg>Choosing an SSG</h2><p>There are <a href=https://jamstack.org/generators/>lots of SSGs</a> out there, but I wanted to use the single-binary ones, which means that the entire SSG is a single, self-contained executable. There are some benefits to this approach, the most obvious of which is that installing, removing, and upgrading the SSG is much easier. You don’t need to install a language runtime, like Ruby for Jekyll or Node.js for Astro or Eleventy. You also don’t need to manage dependencies, as the maintainers of the SSG have already done that and packaged everything into a neat little executable for you. The downside is that it will be much less flexible than using something on top of a language runtime, but if I want flexibility, I’ll just roll my own SSG.<p>This left me with two options that I know of: Hugo and Zola. Hugo is much more mature, has a bigger community, a more well-documented API, and tons of themes and example websites to <del>steal code</del> get inspiration from. However, I decided to use Zola, because it uses the Tera templating engine, also from the same creator. Tera is based on the syntax popularized by Jinja2/Django that I’m very familiar with. It has template inheritance, which significantly removes lots of boilerplate code, and the macro system is so powerful that it’s basically a declarative programming language. I’m not saying the Hugo templating engine is bad; I just prefer something similar to what I already knew. Tera being similar to the Django templating language also means that it partially works on my editor by default. Zola and Tera were created more recently, and there are some rough edges, but they are not too significant.<h2 id=my-experience-with-zola>My experience with Zola</h2><p>After working on this website for a while, I think that Zola is a really great piece of software. It does everything I need it to do; it lets me do whatever I want. I feel like I have a lot of controls without too much effort, even over the generated code. The build time is crazy fast—on my laptop, this site takes <strong>25 ms</strong> to build. All of this makes working with Zola very pleasant, and I think a more mature SSG like Hugo might be even better. I wholeheartedly recommend using SSGs for small to medium websites like blogs, documentations, wikis, cooking recipe sites, …, You can get really far with it before needing a more heavy-duty web framework.<p>Another neat thing about SSGs is that because the site is static, hosting them is extremely cheap and easy. There are free hosting options out there like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, …, so all you need to spend money on is the domain name, which I don’t have, so I literally spent nothing on this website. I used to host this new website on Vercel, because it supports Zola by default, but there were some problems, so I switched back to GitHub Pages. I don’t trust the GitHub action build script, so I just build the website on my laptop and push the generated website to a separate <code>gh-pages</code> branch using <code>git subtree</code>. Despite this, I’d still recommend using Vercel because it’s really fast and easy, and if you use the correct Zola version, nothing will go wrong.<h1 id=what-to-expect-from-this-website>What to expect from this website</h1><p>With all the technical details of this website out of the way, here is what I’m going to do with the website. First, it will still be a project showcasing websites, so this website will be updated with my newest projects. I might even write about new projects if I feel like they deserve a dedicated blog post. With this new website, I want to increase the completeness and quality of my projects before putting them here. I’ll also try to improve older projects, but I won’t prioritize doing them as much as making new ones. So expect the <a href=/works>projects page</a> of this website to be filled with more high-quality softwares showcases.<p>Secondly, as mentioned earlier, I have started a blog about what I thought and learned, or just what I wanted to share. It’ll mostly be about technologies, especially the ones that I’m working with or interested in. Currently, I don’t have a clear vision of what I want to write about, so for the foreseeable future, I’ll just write random things and see what works and what doesn’t. It’s 2024, and blogging isn’t as popular as it was before, but I still want to start and maintain one because at least I can benefit from doing it.</article></main><footer class=footer__container><svg viewbox="0 352.5 960 188.5" class=footer__split preserveaspectratio=none version=1.1 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink><path d="M0 441L22.8 424.5C45.7 408 91.3 375 137 360.8C182.7 346.7 228.3 351.3 274 369.3C319.7 387.3 365.3 418.7 411.2 414.2C457 409.7 503 369.3 548.8 368C594.7 366.7 640.3 404.3 686 421.7C731.7 439 777.3 436 823 429.8C868.7 423.7 914.3 414.3 937.2 409.7L960 405L960 541L937.2 541C914.3 541 868.7 541 823 541C777.3 541 731.7 541 686 541C640.3 541 594.7 541 548.8 541C503 541 457 541 411.2 541C365.3 541 319.7 541 274 541C228.3 541 182.7 541 137 541C91.3 541 45.7 541 22.8 541L0 541Z" fill=#f7f9fb /><path d="M0 477L22.8 467C45.7 457 91.3 437 137 423.8C182.7 410.7 228.3 404.3 274 401.7C319.7 399 365.3 400 411.2 413.5C457 427 503 453 548.8 464.2C594.7 475.3 640.3 471.7 686 456.5C731.7 441.3 777.3 414.7 823 404.5C868.7 394.3 914.3 400.7 937.2 403.8L960 407L960 541L937.2 541C914.3 541 868.7 541 823 541C777.3 541 731.7 541 686 541C640.3 541 594.7 541 548.8 541C503 541 457 541 411.2 541C365.3 541 319.7 541 274 541C228.3 541 182.7 541 137 541C91.3 541 45.7 541 22.8 541L0 541Z" fill=#eff3f7 /><path d="M0 459L22.8 456.2C45.7 453.3 91.3 447.7 137 456.7C182.7 465.7 228.3 489.3 274 494.8C319.7 500.3 365.3 487.7 411.2 476C457 464.3 503 453.7 548.8 451.7C594.7 449.7 640.3 456.3 686 462.5C731.7 468.7 777.3 474.3 823 473.2C868.7 472 914.3 464 937.2 460L960 456L960 541L937.2 541C914.3 541 868.7 541 823 541C777.3 541 731.7 541 686 541C640.3 541 594.7 541 548.8 541C503 541 457 541 411.2 541C365.3 541 319.7 541 274 541C228.3 541 182.7 541 137 541C91.3 541 45.7 541 22.8 541L0 541Z" fill=#e8eef4 stroke=#e8eef4 /></svg><div class=footer__bg><div class=footer>© 2024 Ishan (Huy-Giap Bui).
