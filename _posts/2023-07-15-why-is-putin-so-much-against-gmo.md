Vladimir Putin has been a vocal opponent of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) for many years. He has argued that GMOs are dangerous to human health and the environment, and he has banned the cultivation and import of GMO crops in Russia.

There are a number of reasons why Putin is so opposed to GMOs. One reason is that he believes that they are a threat to Russia's food security. Russia is a major agricultural exporter, and Putin is concerned that GMOs could give foreign companies an unfair advantage in the Russian market.

Another reason why Putin is opposed to GMOs is that he believes that they are not safe. He has cited concerns about the potential health risks of GMOs, and he has also argued that they could have negative environmental consequences.

Putin's views on GMOs are shared by many Russians. A 2016 poll found that only 13% of Russians believe that GMOs are safe. This is in contrast to the United States, where a 2015 poll found that 62% of Americans believe that GMOs are safe.

Putin's opposition to GMOs has been criticized by some scientists and economists. They argue that there is no scientific evidence that GMOs are harmful to human health or the environment. They also argue that GMOs could help to improve food security and reduce the use of pesticides.

Despite these criticisms, Putin has remained steadfast in his opposition to GMOs. He has said that Russia will not allow the cultivation or import of GMO crops, and he has warned that companies that violate this ban will be punished.

It is unclear how Putin's views on GMOs will evolve in the future. However, it is clear that he is determined to keep GMOs out of Russia.
