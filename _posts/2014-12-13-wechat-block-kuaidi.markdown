<div>
     well. It happened today, and I came to talk a few words.
     <br> Still declare first: <b> All remarks are from individuals, which has nothing to do with Ali and my team. </b>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br> The text.
     <br>
     <br> Many Internet companies should have this "benefits" -<b> After working overtime, reimburse the taxi fee </b>.
     <br> Ali is about 9 pm.
     <br>
     <br> I was not used to when I first entered Ali. I thought about going to get off work at 6 o'clock, ate a free dinner, and quickly took the subway home.
     <br> Later, one was that the subway at the peak period was terrible. The second was that there were indeed too many needs to be done. They often said, "Let's talk about this at night ..."
     <br>
     <br> So work overtime at night has become the normal state of many people in the company. Even if it is almost at 8 o'clock today, it will be habitually waiting for about 9 o'clock. <b> Call a car home </b> Essence
     <br>
     <br> So, from 9 to 12 o'clock a day, the sound of car, telephone appointment, and a stream of streams in the company. There is also a WeChat group in our team in private, which is distinguished from the Wangwang group used to work. <b> After playing red envelopes in the taxi software, everyone will share the red envelope in the group. 52 people's groups, sometimes they do not grab in a minute, and the red envelope is gone. </b>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br> It is well known, the relationship between Ali and fast taxis.
     <br>
     <br> Therefore, there seems to be a vulgar in the group, and there have never been Didi red envelopes. <b> Due to the super user stickiness brought by the red envelope back, everyone even started to use the car. </b>
     <br>
     <img class = "shadow" src = "/img/in-post/post-kuaidi -jpg" width = "260">>
     As a result, the good times didn't last long, and WeChat suddenly played such a hand and blocked the fast taxi.
     <br> Everyone discovered that day, and also discussed the countermeasures ... <b> For example, "Share on Weibo first, then copy the link, and send it to Wangwangqun" ... </b>
     <br>
     <br> Hmm. My TM also feels very hard. Essence
     <br> So about the WeChat group was silent for a day ...
     <br>
     <br> <b> Then the next day ... The first Didi red envelope appeared in the group! </b> What was the copywriting at that time: "<i> 4 small partners, 3 uses Didi! The red envelope summon new partners to return to the team! </i>" "
     <br> <b> I, I, I, I couldn't help but entangle the "values" for a while, put down the mobile phone debug and go ... </b>
     <br> <b> Wait for me to think about it again, click on the link: What ... "The red envelope has been grabbed." </b>
     <br>
     <br>. Essence Essence
     <br> <b> Later. </b> <b> I can't help it at all, the drip red envelope is floating. </b>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br> Alas I just want to say: <b> This is just one day ... the user's habit is completely turned over. Even the allies ... did not save. </b>
     <br>
     <img class = "shadow" src = "/img/in-post/post-kuaidi-2.jpg" width = "260">>
     So I still came back by Didi today ... The moment I shared the red envelope, I suddenly felt a little bit of my heart. I came back and wrote this answer.
     <br>
     <br> After talking for a long time, it seems that I didn't say any dry goods ...
     <br> Actually, you have to ask me if this is violating the law of equality and opening up of the Internet. I think the above <a data-hash = "8F7D284bb1a97DEAA4533A6190206ECB" href = "http://www.zhihu.com/people/8F7D284bb1a97DEAA4533ECB" class = " Member_Mention "data-editable =" true "data-title ="@覃 Tommy "Data-TIP =" P $ B $ 8F7D284BB1A97DEAA4533A6190206ECB ">@覃 覃 </a> <A data-hash =" 43d639a3d763d3d3DAD945EC "href =" http: // www.zhihu.com/people/43d639A3D763DAD948E0BC4C645EEC "class =" You can choose by yourself.
     <br>
     <br> But about how to look at it, in fact, this time I am as an ordinary user ... I really feel: <b> "The sense of conscience and small justice is really weak in the face of strong needs" </b> <b " </b> <b> Not to mention that this strong demand is killed, and at the same time, he also provides alternatives with both hands. </b>
     <br>
     <br> <b> <u> So the big manufacturers, you can tear it up, you need to hit the user's face, just give more sugar and give jujube. </u> </b>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br> Oh yes, today WeChat announced that the circle of friends restricted sharing unpacking web pages.
     <br> <b> jujube! Intersection Intersection Intersection </b>
     <br>
     <br>
