Yes, you can share a link that will automatically open ChatGPT and type the prompt. There are a few different ways to do this.

One way is to use a service like Prompt Genius. Prompt Genius is a Chrome extension that allows you to create links that will automatically open ChatGPT and type a prompt. To create a link, you simply need to enter the prompt in the Prompt Genius extension and then click on the "Generate Link" button. The extension will then generate a link that you can share with others. When someone clicks on the link, it will automatically open ChatGPT and type the prompt.
