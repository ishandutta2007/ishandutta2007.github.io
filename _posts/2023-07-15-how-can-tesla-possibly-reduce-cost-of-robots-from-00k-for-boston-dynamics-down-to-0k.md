There are a number of ways that Tesla could reduce the cost of its robots from $200,000 to $20,000. Here are a few ideas:

* **Use less expensive materials.** Boston Dynamics' robots are made with high-quality materials, such as aluminum, steel, and carbon fiber. These materials are strong and durable, but they are also expensive. Tesla could use less expensive materials, such as plastics and composites, to reduce the cost of its robots.
* **Use less complex sensors and software.** Boston Dynamics' robots are equipped with advanced sensors and software. These sensors allow the robots to see, sense their surroundings, and navigate. The software that runs on the robots is also complex and expensive to develop. Tesla could use less complex sensors and software to reduce the cost of its robots.
* **Mass-produce the robots.** Boston Dynamics robots are not mass-produced. They are hand-assembled by engineers, which makes them more expensive to manufacture. Tesla could mass-produce its robots to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
* **Simplify the design of the robots.** Boston Dynamics robots are complex machines. They have a lot of moving parts and complex electronics. Tesla could simplify the design of its robots to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
* **Use open-source hardware and software.** Boston Dynamics develops its own hardware and software. This is expensive to do. Tesla could use open-source hardware and software to reduce the cost of its robots.

It is important to note that there are trade-offs involved in reducing the cost of robots. For example, using less expensive materials may make the robots less durable. Using less complex sensors and software may make the robots less capable. However, by carefully considering these trade-offs, Tesla could reduce the cost of its robots significantly.

In addition to the above, Tesla could also reduce the cost of its robots by:

* **Using economies of scale.** As Tesla produces more robots, the cost of each robot will decrease. This is because the company will be able to spread the fixed costs of manufacturing over a larger number of robots.
* **Increasing the efficiency of manufacturing.** Tesla could improve the efficiency of its manufacturing process by using more automated methods. This would reduce the amount of labor required to manufacture each robot, which would in turn reduce the cost.
* **Developing new manufacturing techniques.** Tesla could develop new manufacturing techniques that allow it to produce robots more cheaply. For example, the company could use 3D printing to manufacture some of the components of its robots.

By taking these steps, Tesla could significantly reduce the cost of its robots. This would make robots more affordable and accessible to a wider range of businesses and consumers.
