## 前言

从 2010 年 iPhone 4 横空出世席卷中国，到时隔不到半月的 Apple 2015 发布会。短短几年里，身边就几乎再也看不到“非智能手机”的身影了。

想想发布那时（2010.6.8），博主应该还是一个高一小屁孩，等着暑假快点到来。虽然父上大人用着 iPhone 3GS ，不过那时我对 Apple 可没啥感觉，还用着后来被 Apple 干翻的 Nokia （5320），抱着算是被 Apple 干翻的 IBM ，偶尔玩玩后来被 Apple 干翻的 Adobe Flash……  
虽然不是含着着金 iPhone 出生的一代，但好歹也算是摸着电脑长大的一代人，估摸着也算是 **Digital native** 了。你说这词是什么意思？别急，我们慢慢说。


## 正文

今年暑假回了两个老家，也看望了不少长辈。  
长辈们的手机果然都进行了可以想见的升级，除了爷爷奶奶辈外，清一色的 iPhone 或者 Android 4.2+ ，呃，没有 WP。

智能手机啊智能手机，Smart Phone —— 聪明又能干的手机。可是每每我看到年龄稍微大点的长辈们顶着一附花镜，瞪大了眼睛，一只手托着，另一只手则伸出一根手指小心翼翼得戳着硕大的屏幕时，我就瞬间觉得这哪里是 Smart ，分明是 Stupid Phone 。于是我就看着父辈们不厌其烦得教着老人家如何解锁，如何打电话，回短信。却又常常要像子女们请教微信里的图片存到了哪（这基本都是 Android 的毛病），朋友圈的文章如何分享转发，视频和小视频为什么不一样，视频通话怎么玩这一类“高级问题”。  

这现象既尴尬又有趣，至少我 10+ 岁时还觉得自己什么都得请教父母。可是这一代孩子，居然能天天被父母请教手机问题然后理直气壮得回一句：“你怎么连这都不会？”  

<br>
**最让我惊讶的还是我两岁的小侄女阿布。**  
两岁的小孩子，刚刚能跑能跳，学会说话也不久，甚是可爱。

第一次感受阿布的神奇，是跟阿布和阿布爸（姐夫）在车的后座上坐着，阿布突然就向姐夫喊起了“手机，要手机…”。“就玩一会儿哦” 于是姐夫从口袋里掏出了 iPhone ，放到了比手机小好几号的小手上。我第一反应只是觉得好玩，大概小孩子觉得这个黑漆漆但是又能被点亮的“玩具”很好玩吧，姐夫和姐姐又无时不在教小孩子认东西，小孩子记得这个“玩具”叫作手机也很正常。

**紧接着阿布就用她的行为狠狠得打了我的脸：Home 键 → 滑动解锁 → 照片 App → 点开一张照片然后开始左翻右看；一串 Combo 动作娴熟一气呵成。**  

大家脑补一下柯南那个“脑海中‘唰’的一道亮光”！对对我当时就是这样，**然后就犯了职业病，连续几天都开始观察阿布是如何玩手机的。**（小孩子玩手机不好，是要控制时间的）


#### I. 超强的学习能力

小孩子的大脑思维简单却又有着惊人的学习能力，他们十分擅长模仿，而且能非常高效的对信息进行记忆和处理。

**我确信阿布已经在无数次学习中完美得理解了 Home 键的含义。**阿布知道主屏上的每一个长得一样的东西（App Icon）都可以点击，点击之后就会进入一个新的东西，如果阿布不喜欢，她知道按 Home 键返回主屏。

阿布不完全具备分辨众多 icon 的能力，但唯独最喜欢“照片”这个应用，她总是可以在几次划屏之后找到并打开它。  
**可以说理解下图 “主屏幕与应用” 这样的一级逻辑是相对比较轻松的，而且 Home 键作为物理按键，认知成本也比屏幕中的虚拟按钮要低得多。**

<pre>
    Icon
主屏幕 ⇌ 应用
    Home 
</pre>

However, the performance of Abu in the photo application is enough to explain the problem: Abu not only can classify the "photo block", but also know**“既然一张照片可以点开，那么每张都是可以的”**。阿布居然还学会了 **Back 按键**的使用！  
You know that Abu must not know the text on the right side of BACK arrow. I guess that Abu may be through space positioning (upper corner of the screen), or it may be through graphics (you must know that people's cognitive ability to graphics is much higher than text). In short, Abu learned BACK, and you can perform the "so complicated operation" in the figure below:

<pre>
   Photo icon One ONE
Main screen ⇌ album list ⇌ photo album ⇌ single photo
     Home Back Back
</pre>

And in fact, there is a "pit" in the "single photo": **If you click the photo, all navigation will disappear (switch to the full screen view mode), and you need to click the photo navigation to return.** I ca n’t know whether Abu understands this law, but once Abu see the back key, I know how to return to it by pressing it.

#### II. Perfect understanding metaphor

Children's thinking is straightforward. They don't try to cover up any thoughts, and they will do whatever they think.

We all know that if one thing is on your right, then you need to pull this "world" to the left and do a relative exercise to see this thing again. Children don’t need to know what relative exercise, but naturally you can understand — ** Abu knows that you can move this small world on the screen on the screen. Abu knows what you have taken away. Essence**

这就是我们常说的**物理隐喻**，小孩子不知道物理也不知道什么隐喻，But it works.
But that's not this that surprised me. If I have an iPhone when I am 2 years old, I should also be so blindly picked up ...
What really made me feel that I had to write this article was: Once, I played my iPhone for Abu, and Abu often opened the album to start turning.**

Yes, right, that is, the push notification of ↓↓↓↓ from top to the top.

<pre>
WeChat 
Kant sent you a red envelope
</pre>

**Then the climax came, Abu stretched out his little hand very calmly and pushed me to me ↑↑↑↑ Go back! Intersection**  
You must not experience how surprised me at the time.

**Metaphor! If you don't want it if you don't want it, can you go back if you don't want it?** Children's understanding of the metaphor of the digital world interaction is really finished. I don't know how much Digital Immigrant (will be explained below).


####  III. 世界观的树立

why is that? Why can children have the ability to understand the digital world?

我的答案不难理解：**The digital world has perfectly incorporated in Abu's world system. Abu has experienced the "law" of the digital world since he was a child. For Abu, this kind of learning is completely different from her learning of the real world.**

**这种感觉就好像我们从小其实就在感受这个世界的物理规律**：We do n’t know that there is a gravity, but we know that things will fall from the hand; we do n’t know hot exchange, but we know that cold water and hot water can be paired with warm water; we do n’t know The door will save effort ...

There is a very fun case that proves the establishment of the system in Abu's brain: there are many UI screenshots in my album,**
Screenshot is a more difficult cognition for Abu (as if most animals cannot recognize the mirror)**Essence When the Back button becomes the definition of "returning" the virtual world in Abu's mind, even if it is BACK in the screenshot, Abu will not hesitate to go up, but there is no effect —— **This violates Abu’s cognition, so she will feel doubtful and uneasy**，直到下一次 Back 奏效……

The worldview is a thing that needs to be established for a long time. ** When we are the most ignorant of the world like children, we are also most curious about the world, so everything in front of us is in the brain. Then the brain has a fast memory and learning, and gradually forms your perception of this world. **
Therefore, the worldview is also a very stubborn thing. It is difficult to destroy the part that has been established, and there is not much to stand for the new things -this can also be regarded as explaining why children learn digital devices so fast, and the older the age, the older the age, the older the age. It is relatively more difficult to accept (of course this is actually related to the life activities of different ages, here is just a metaphor)

Speaking of which, we can finally return to the initial question:
What is Digital Native? And the corresponding Digital Immigrant?

> **Digital native，数字原住民**： Refers to a generation who has been accustomed to the Internet and wireless technology since birth (LogicalLly there is a whole generation of Individuals for WHOM Concepts Such as the International and Wireless Technologian Humdrum, BeCAUSE They'VE NEVER LIVED in a World where they did ' t exce.
"
>  **Digital immigrant，数字移民**：
Refers to the earlier generation of people, who has been willing or reluctant to adapt to this digital world, and apply various digital tools to life.（Digital immigrants are their antithesis, being the folks born earlier who, either reluctantly or enthusiastically, have adapted to the digital world and incorporated its tools into their lives.）

This is the case, but the boundary is actually blurred. What is really important is: ** Perhaps in this fast -growing world, only by maintaining children's curiosity and original intentions can we be easily abandoned by the times.**

## 结语

I was pleased to be a master in the field of computer or interaction in the future, but I thought about it.
**我更愿意相信这一代小孩子都将具备如此神力**Essence Just as if the world has re -established order, then the first to adapt to the order must be the children born under the new order. Because they do not have any past in the world, there is no Boundary.

我经常想象假如我出世在一个以魔法为秩序的纪元里，那个世界里的小孩子一定生来就具备对魔法的领悟与操纵能力。**我想那种能力或许不是血脉或者种族里自带的天赋吧，而是从你呱呱坠地，开始认知、学习这个世界的那一天起，魔法就习以为常地印在了你的世界观里。**你从小就知道母亲空手就可以变个小太阳温暖你，而父亲则可以挥挥手放出一片星空来逗你开心。

**于是你坚定不移，当你第一次有力气挥动你的小胳膊时，一道流星划过天际。**
