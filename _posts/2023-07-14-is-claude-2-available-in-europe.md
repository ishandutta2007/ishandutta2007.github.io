No, Claude 2 is not currently available in Europe. As of July 2023, it is only available in the United States and the United Kingdom. Anthropic, the company that developed Claude 2, has not yet announced plans to make it available in other countries.

There are a few possible reasons why Claude 2 is not yet available in Europe. One possibility is that Anthropic is still working on complying with European data privacy regulations. Another possibility is that they are waiting to see how Claude 2 is received in the United States and the United Kingdom before expanding to other markets.
