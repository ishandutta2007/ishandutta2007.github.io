Yes, you can ask the same question to BARD, Bing, ChatGPT, and Claude at once. There are a few different ways to do this.

One way is to use a service like GrandGPT. GrandGPT is a web application that allows you to ask questions to multiple chat AIs at the same time. You can connect to ChatGPT, BARD, Bing, and Claude, and then ask them the same question. GrandGPT will then display the responses from each AI side-by-side, so you can easily compare them.

Another way to ask the same question to multiple AIs is to use a programming language like Python. You can use the Python API for BARD, Bing, ChatGPT, and Claude to send them the same question. The APIs will then return the responses from each AI, which you can then print out or save to a file.

Finally, you can also ask the same question to multiple AIs by using a chatbot framework like Rasa. Rasa is a framework that allows you to create chatbots that can interact with humans in a natural way. You can use Rasa to create a chatbot that can ask the same question to multiple AIs and then display the responses to the user.

Whichever method you choose, asking the same question to multiple AIs can be a helpful way to get different perspectives on a topic. It can also help you to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different AIs.
