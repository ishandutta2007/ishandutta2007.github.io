## Review

去年 5 月，大二的我拿到阿里的交互实习生 Offer，成为阿里的实习员工，刚好过去一个年头。

In August, thanked [@8 8] (http://weibo.com/jayli), he agreed to the application of my transfer to the front -end team of the aerial travel.**航旅事业群-无线业务部-无线技术-前端团队-前端三组**，从此开始了一名**前端程序猿**的职业生涯。

My first Mentor was everyone's "little sister" @我 我, but unfortunately, she was leaving earlier earlier and returned to north to teach. I followed her to study and fight on the business line of H5 Hotel, and changed from a little ghost who even used Git into a little ghost who could fight independently.
When the Acting H5 hotel/group buying business line, I also thank @在 在 for the guidance and trust. It is my most of me.

My second MENTOR is the @我 我 我 我 我 我 我, former mobile phone Tencent, responsible for the team's CSS framework, and a very philosophical life. We took the work of H5 red envelopes, but unfortunately there was no chance to learn more CSS from the master.

有幸来阿里工作一遭，加入航旅前端团队，经历 [离线包/Hybrid容器共建](https://www.zhihu.com/question/31316032/answer/75236718) 这样的牛逼项目，负责过酒店详情、团购详情重构、个人中心红包等工作，为象声汇做过第一版 Logo、海报、颁奖证书，进行过一次团队分享[《聊聊产品与旅行》](http://huxpro.coding.me/2015/06/15/alitrip-strategy/)，更有幸认识大家。

在航旅的 270 天里，我还经历了不少**大事件**：

* 一次 阿里 IPO （千载难逢的大事，可惜我没有股票，战利品是一件纪念 T 恤）
* 一次 新品牌发布 （*阿里旅行·去啊* 的发布，BU 的大事，战利品还是一件 T 恤）
* 一次 年会 （北京 office 第一次大规模年会，马云老陆 Lucy 悉数到场）
* 一次 双十一 （双十一购物狂欢节，有幸从内部参与一次）
* 一次 Outing （每年才一次的公派娱乐，滑雪＋温泉记忆深刻）
* 一次 Team Building（晴舞姐的 lastday ，难得的团建）
* 一次 中秋节 （战利品是包装特别用心的“马云牌”月饼）


真的运气非常好，不但该经历的都经历了，连 IPO 这么难得的也撞上了。

* @: Master! Jingqiang Er ~ Although always scolding PD in the circle of friends, it is actually very reliable to live. Hahaha
* @: Homepage Guardian! You are always there when overtime, then eat together, and then force to work hard to work OTZ
* @: Master Ye! Although I never let me call my brother to learn from each other, I really told me a lot of philosophy in life, super useful
* @: Mai Ba! I can talk about it in particular. Fate comes from sitting next to me. When you and Shu Bo moved away, I still can't bear it T T, do you remember that you take my chassis scooter!
* @上: I am the same as the post -90s, and I can talk! I often eat together, sleep for a house when Outing, I will ask me in the morning after snoring at night, and then apologize to particularly cute hahaha
* @: I can't tell which group you are! However, I often eat together together to eat together, especially NICE. Thank you very much. I am very happy when doing a hotel together!
* @夕: Although I have left the office, I can't see it, but I must make up for it. Super Nice is super reliable, handsome and interesting
* @: Although I have left the office, I ca n’t see it, but I must make up. I am particularly grateful.
* @: Although I have been transferred, I can't see it, but I have to make up. I felt like a big villain for a time! The most impressive thing is that I just came in GIT and wrote the wrong. Look at my log to help me roll back OTZ. At that time, I felt particularly fierce.
* @: Intern friends! You actually left the office first. But I know you all signed the three parties

其他组的我就捡比较熟悉的说啦：

* @: Alumni Sister! It is particularly cute, and I am responsible for Xiangshenghui to do my best
* @: Friends full of combat effectiveness! Super youthful, optimistic about you ~!
* @E: Hey Flasher! Flasher really loves animation and interaction, I can talk about it ~
* @: It seems like playing together? Hahaha, there is no reason to feel particularly cute!
* @: Did you leave? I have played together for a long time!

当然，还有很多前端、UED 、测试、后端、行政 的小伙伴们，就没法一一照顾到啦。

**希望所有人都能工作顺利（少加班）、生活开心（多旅游）、身体健康哈。**

## Future

距离毕业还有一年多的光景，前路未卜，还是想到处逛逛，多看看再做选择。

在陆续看了几家公司后，我决定前往**微信电影票**开始我的下一段旅程。特别巧的是，带队的饼饼居然也曾是我们团队的“老人”，花名 @痴灵 

世界这么大，更要 Keep Contact.
