Well it [has](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/truthgpt-no-hallucination/ekaamfcgakjaolehpokjkilkghkbanic?hl=en&authuser=0), if you are talking about Elon's then you might have to wait.

Elon Musk has not yet announced a specific launch date for his "truth-seeking" AI, which he has dubbed TruthGPT. However, he has said that he is working on it with a team of engineers and researchers, and that he hopes to launch it in the near future.

In a tweet on April 17, 2023, Musk said that TruthGPT is "designed to be a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe." He also said that the AI will be "open-source and non-profit," and that it will be "used to explore the mysteries of the universe and to help people understand the world around them."

It is unclear how TruthGPT will differ from other large language models (LLMs) that are currently available. However, Musk has said that he wants TruthGPT to be "more truth-seeking" than other LLMs. This could mean that TruthGPT will be designed to be more objective and less biased than other LLMs. It could also mean that TruthGPT will be better at detecting and correcting misinformation.

Only time will tell when TruthGPT will be launched and what impact it will have. However, Musk's announcement has generated a lot of interest in the AI community, and it is likely that TruthGPT will be a significant development in the field of artificial intelligence.
