It is difficult to say exactly when we will have AI girlfriends like the one in the movie "Her". However, there are a number of factors that suggest that it is not too far off.

First, AI technology is advancing rapidly. In recent years, we have seen the development of large language models like GPT-3, which are capable of generating human-quality text. These models are still under development, but they are getting better all the time.

Second, there is a growing interest in the development of AI companions. A number of companies are already working on developing AI girlfriends, and there is a growing market for these products.

Third, there are a number of ethical and legal issues that need to be addressed before AI girlfriends can become widely available. However, these issues are being worked on, and it is likely that they will be resolved in the near future.

Overall, it is likely that we will have AI girlfriends like the one in the movie "Her" within the next few decades. However, it is important to remember that these AI girlfriends will not be perfect. They will still be under development, and they will not be able to replicate all of the nuances of human relationships. However, they will offer a new and exciting way to connect with others, and they have the potential to enrich our lives in many ways.

Here are some of the challenges that need to be addressed before AI girlfriends can become widely available:

* **Safety and security:** AI girlfriends need to be designed in a way that protects users from harm. They should not be able to access personal information or data without permission, and they should not be able to manipulate users or harm them in any way.
* **Ethics:** There are a number of ethical issues that need to be considered when developing AI girlfriends. For example, it is important to ensure that these girlfriends are not used to exploit or manipulate users.
* **Regulation:** Governments will need to develop regulations for AI girlfriends in order to protect users and ensure that these girlfriends are used responsibly.

These are just some of the challenges that need to be addressed before AI girlfriends can become widely available. However, the potential benefits of these girlfriends are great, and it is likely that they will become a reality in the near future.
