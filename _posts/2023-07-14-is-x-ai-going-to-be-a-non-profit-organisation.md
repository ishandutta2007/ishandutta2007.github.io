As of July 2023, there is no public information about whether x.ai will be a non-profit organization. The company's website does not mention its status as a non-profit, and there have been no press releases or statements from the company about its plans.

However, there are some clues that suggest that x.ai may be a non-profit. The company's mission statement is to "democratize artificial intelligence for good," and its website emphasizes the importance of using AI for social good. Additionally, the company's leadership team includes a number of people who have worked for non-profits in the past.

Of course, it is also possible that x.ai will be a for-profit company. The company has raised a significant amount of venture capital funding, and it is likely that its investors will want to see a return on their investment. However, if x.ai does decide to become a for-profit company, it is likely that it will continue to focus on using AI for social good.

Only time will tell whether x.ai will be a non-profit organization. However, the company's mission statement and leadership team suggest that it is a possibility.
