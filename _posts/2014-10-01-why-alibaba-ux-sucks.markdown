     <br>
     <br> <b> A word of words, priority. </b>
     <br> This priority is not determined by who or which BOSS, but the results of <b> long -term market competition and business needs </b>
     <br>
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> <b> Why is Penguin's APP user experience better? </b>
         </li>
     </ul>
     The main products of Penguin's house, QQ, WeChat, QQ music, QQ space, etc., are mostly IM (instant messaging), SNS (social networks), digital entertainment and other products.
     <br>
     <br> <b> Such products often must "directly rely on excellent product services and user experience" to win users. </b>
     <br>
     <br> If this is not good, the product cannot stand out in the competition. This also makes <b> inside the penguin, around this part of the requirements, needs, and feedback </b> <b> must be the most, so that penguins have to do this </b>.
     <br>
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> <b> So why is Ali's app user experience poor? </b>
         </li>
     </ul>
     The main products of Ali Department, from 1688, Taobao, to Alipay, Tmall, Taobao travel, Taotao, Yitao, Wangwang, either e -commerce products, or e -commerce extension products.
     <br>
     <br> The core competitiveness of such products (or the difficulties to do well), often <b> "how to deal with the real economy, even the government to deal with", </b> <b> "How to do a good job" </B> instead of excellent user experience.
     <br>
     <br> It should be said that Ali has never paid attention to user experience, and has paid more attention to these two years. However, because of this market environment, <b> Ali must first complete these higher priority demand (massive business, operating needs) to seize the market, </b>
     <br> This leads to too much energy Focus inside Ali to go to the client experience.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br> Even if the above answers the question of the subject,
     <br> However, know the practice, say a few more words:
     <br>
     <br> <b> In fact, the answers above can also be said to say that they are all rhetoric. </b>
     <br>
     <br> When I just joined Ali, I was wondering and even depressed. Until I started to contact more projects, I can gradually understand "why this is like this."
     <br>
     <br> <b> But this is not enough to become an excuse. </b>
     <br> <b> Should I change it? Of course it should be changed. </b>
     <br>
     <br> I believe almost all Ali people, especially UED, must not want this.
     <br> It can only be said that this requires Ali to invest more people, more time, and more efforts to do a good job
     <br>
