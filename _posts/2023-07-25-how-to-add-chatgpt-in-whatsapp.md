As of my last update in September 2021, it was not possible to directly add Chatbot models like GPT-3 or ChatGPT into WhatsApp. WhatsApp is primarily designed for person-to-person communication and does not have native support for running custom chatbot models.

However, there are alternative ways to integrate chatbots with WhatsApp-like platforms. Here are some possible insights:

1. **Third-party Chatbot Platforms**: There are third-party chatbot development platforms that allow you to build chatbots and integrate them with WhatsApp using WhatsApp Business API. These platforms often provide user-friendly interfaces to create, train, and manage chatbots without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

2. **Twilio API**: Twilio is a popular cloud communications platform that offers APIs for integrating messaging and other communication services, including WhatsApp. You can use Twilio's APIs to create and deploy chatbots that interact with users on WhatsApp.

3. **Using WhatsApp Business API**: WhatsApp provides a Business API that allows businesses to communicate with customers on the platform. While the API itself does not support direct integration with GPT-3 or ChatGPT, you can build a middleware service that takes messages from WhatsApp, sends them to the GPT-3 or ChatGPT API for processing, and then sends the response back to the user through the WhatsApp Business API.

4. **Custom Chatbot Development**: If you have access to a GPT-3 or ChatGPT API and are experienced in software development, you can create a custom chatbot application that interfaces with the WhatsApp API. This approach requires more technical knowledge but provides greater flexibility and control over the chatbot's behavior.

Remember that the technology landscape is continuously evolving, and new tools or integrations might have emerged since my last update. It's essential to check for the latest updates and documentation from WhatsApp and relevant chatbot platforms or APIs to see if there have been any changes or new possibilities in integrating chatbots with WhatsApp.
