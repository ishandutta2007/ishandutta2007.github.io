Putin is not against AI in general. He has said that AI is "the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind." However, he has also expressed concerns about the potential dangers of AI, such as its potential to be used for malicious purposes.

In a 2017 speech, Putin said that "whoever becomes the leader in this sphere [AI] will become the ruler of the world." He also said that "AI could be the most powerful tool for good or evil."

Putin's government has taken steps to promote the development of AI in Russia. In 2019, the government launched a national AI strategy that aims to make Russia a global leader in AI by 2030.

However, the Russian government has also taken steps to regulate AI. In 2021, the government passed a law that requires companies to obtain a license before using AI in certain applications, such as facial recognition and self-driving cars.

The Russian government's approach to AI is complex and reflects the country's dual goals of promoting the development of AI while also addressing its potential dangers. It remains to be seen how the Russian government's approach to AI will evolve in the years to come.

Here are some of the specific dangers of AI that Putin has mentioned:

* **AI could be used to create autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention.**
* **AI could be used to manipulate people's thoughts and behavior.**
* **AI could lead to mass unemployment, as machines become capable of doing many of the jobs that are currently done by humans.**

Putin has also warned that AI could be used to create a "digital dictatorship" in which governments use AI to control their citizens.

Overall, Putin's views on AI are mixed. He sees the potential benefits of AI, but he is also aware of the potential dangers. It remains to be seen how the Russian government will address these dangers in the years to come.
