<p> Oops ~ Don't stand in line. In fact, this is a very interesting topic. Let us look at it a little bit
     <br>
     <br> Oh yes, thank you demon ~. I am a NEXUS 5 user. Of course, the system is Pure Android Kitkat (Stinky Valley Fan! Click DOWN! Hey, I haven't given a conclusion yet)
     <br> <b> After all, answer questions, give a clear answer first </b>:
     <br>
     <br> <b> No. (</B> <b> For Chinese users, Pure Android is not better than MIUI or Flyme experience. </B> <b>) </b>

     <p> From the answer that "actually more than follow", we can see that everyone is anxious to stand in the team: </p>

     <ul>
         <li> Google Service! Is it easy to turn over the wall! Geek stood over and had a taste forced to be native. </li>
         <li> I have never used Pure, domestic Google can be used! Intersection Localization is more important. It is easy to use decisive MIUI/Flyme! (（（And charm powder actually reached a consensus on the outside) </li>
     </ul>
     <br> From the answer, we can also see that Chinese users are indeed an overly complicated group. What about this problem?
     <br>
     <br> <b> Mathematics teacher has taught, classified discussion! </b>
     <br> (Come, start to be serious. Note that I only divide in two categories.
     <br>
     <br>

     <p> Let's talk about it first: </p>

     <ul>
         <li> <b> Why do Geek users like to use Pure Android? : </B>
         </li>
     </ul> In China, there are many obstacles to using Pure Android: It is well known that Google has been killed by the wall. The G+that can be on the GMAIL last year is basically scrapped. After returning to China, Google Now does not open VPN. No Internet connection ... So why do you use it?
     <br>
     <br> <b> Because these people are Geek! </b> This group of valley powder, Android powder, IT technology powder, designers, engineers, this group of people full of technical plots, for our taste (forced), hanging VPN, connected with the American version of Play Store, with the GMS of Android/Material Design, Chrome Beta, FB, Twitter, WhatsApp ... I went all the way.
     <br>
     <br> Look! How easy is the Action Bar + Navigation DRAWER!
     <br> Look! Can FIXED TABS slip!
     <br> Look! Not! ART opens properly smooth explosion iOS!
     <br> Look! Where will the native Android use the card? Intersection Are you up 4.4.4?
     <br>
     <br> <b> Where can I worry about these people. </b> NEXUS that cannot be bought in China, no GMS is used, this is not called.
     <br>
     <br>

     <p> So, </p>

     <ul>
         <li> <b> Why aren't non -Geek users suitable for using Pure Android? : </B>
         </li>
     </ul> GMS's problem is not much to say, it is not necessary to use it properly. Switching between VPN is also troublesome.
     <br> Not to mention the problem that Pure Android is not so good (of course you can brush CM),
     <br> Let's look at the core question directly:
     <br>
     <br> <b> "Pure Android's interactive design is really better than MIUI / Flyme?" <br> < / b>
     <br> <b> No. </b>
     <br> <b> The so -called design, the first thing to consider is the target user. </b>
     <br>
     <br> Why does Pure Android interactive design make Geek feel that the user experience is good?
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> Foreign standard Android Design ecological environment to create a unified Pure Android experience </li>
         <li> more advanced gesture/app use brings a lot of convenience (typical examples of Swipepad) </li>
         <li> They can easily understand the complex logic of Android </li>
         <li> With the thought of engineers, they can always avoid some design problems by themselves </li>
     </ul>
     <br> What about Pure Android to ordinary users?
     <br> <b> "These advantages are basically gone" </b>, instead, the chaotic domestic ecological environment brings most Chinese users' strange strangeness of Android Design, which brings higher Android logic than iOS. The cost of learning ...
     <br>
     <br> The localization of MIUI/Flyme in design is mainly to solve this problem.
     <br> We can see that in fact, MIUI/Flyme does most of the work. In addition to vision, <b> simplify information level, reduce interactive learning costs, cover the too complicated part of the Android system, in terms of ease of use, iOS closer </b>.
     <br>
     <br> If MIUI/Flyme can only be tied with Pure Android ...
     <br>
     <br> <b> MIUI and Flyme's localization is far from finishing: </b>
     <br>
     <br> Do you always use the domestic Internet to serve in China?
     <br> <b> Integrated, </b> I will integrate all of you to create a one -stop service
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> Application Store
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Cloud Storage/Cloud Services (provided or cooperated by yourself)
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Digital Entertainment Consumption (Music/Game/Reading/Video/theme/Wallpaper/ringtone ...)
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Safe (Xiaobai's favorite system cleanup, strange number interception ...)
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Life Service (Payment, map, courier, ordering, taxi, travel ...)
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Social (Meitu, quickly share ...)
             <br>
         </li>
         <li> Too much. In short, what you want, you do n’t have to work with you if you do n’t have it.
             <br>
         </li>
     </ul> <b> Not cool enough? </b>
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> Xiaomi, tablet, box, TV, route ... MIUI's multi -screen experience </li>
         <li> Meizu, united smart hardware, watch aircraft socket ... Connect to meizu </li>
     </ul> <b> Low channel cost (not price) </b>. This is actually very important
     <br>
     <ul>
         <li> It is easy to brush, the adapter is wide and stable. </li>
         <li> You can buy it in China, there are even experience stores offline, you can teach you to use it. </li>
     </ul>
     <br> Not to mention that for most of the Geek users, although the mobile phone is no longer just as simple as the communication tools of the year, at best, it is just a smart electronic device. <b> It can easily and quickly enjoy the mainstream Internet applications and services in China, and it is enough to complete daily needs </b>.
     <br>
     <br> <b> MIUI/Flyme's achievements in this area are far more comparable to Pure Android. </b>
     <br>
     <br> So my conclusion is:
     <br>
     <br> <b> For Chinese users, Pure Android is not better than MIUI or Flyme. </b>
     <br> <b> For most Chinese users, MIUI or Flyme is better than </b> <b> Pure Android </b> <b> experience. </b>
