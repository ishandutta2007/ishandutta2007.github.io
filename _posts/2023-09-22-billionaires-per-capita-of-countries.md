It is important to note that this table is based on population estimates from the World Bank, and the number of billionaires in each country is based on the Forbes World's Billionaires list. Both of these data sources are subject to some degree of error. Additionally, the table does not take into account the distribution of wealth within each country, meaning that it is possible for a country with a high number of billionaires per capita to also have a high level of poverty.
